# 🎬 Movie Poster Genre Classifier

Multi-label movie genre classification from poster images using deep learning. This model predicts movie genres directly from poster artwork using a fine-tuned ResNet50 architecture.

## 🎯 Model Description

- **Architecture**: ResNet50 (transfer learning)
- **Framework**: FastAI/PyTorch
- **Task**: Multi-label image classification
- **Training Data**: ~7,900 movie posters with genre labels
- **Genres**: Action, Adventure, Animation, Biography, Comedy, Crime, Documentary, Drama, Family, Fantasy, History, Horror, Music, Mystery, News, Romance, Sci-Fi, Sport, Thriller, War, Western

## 🚀 Usage

### Quick Start with Python

```python
from fastai.vision.all import *

# Load the model
learn = load_learner('movie_genre_classifier_export.pkl')

# Predict from image path
pred_class, pred_idxs, probs = learn.predict('poster.jpg')

# Get top 3 genres
top_probs, top_idxs = probs.topk(3)
top_genres = [learn.dls.vocab[i] for i in top_idxs]

for genre, prob in zip(top_genres, top_probs):
    print(f"{genre}: {prob:.1%}")
```

### Gradio Web Interface

```python
python app_gradio.py
```

Then open your browser to interact with the model via a web UI.

## 📊 Performance

The model uses several improvements for better accuracy:

- ✅ **Validation Split**: 80/20 train/validation split for proper evaluation
- ✅ **Optimized Training**: 10+ epochs with discriminative learning rates
- ✅ **Custom Augmentations**: Poster-specific augmentations (no flipping, minimal rotation)
- ✅ **Mixed Precision**: FP16 training for efficiency
- ✅ **Multiple Metrics**: Accuracy, F1, Precision, Recall tracking

### Key Features

- **Multi-label Prediction**: Can predict multiple genres per poster
- **Confidence Scores**: Returns probability for each genre
- **Threshold Tuning**: Customizable confidence threshold per genre
- **Test Time Augmentation**: Optional TTA for improved accuracy
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple posters at once

## 🏋️ Training

To train your own model:

```bash
